Commodore C65/C64DX information file #2.

Following is the 2nd revision of the Commodore C65 (64DX) information
FAQ file.  I was requested by Marko to attempt to maintain the file,
partly due to the fact that I'm one of the C65 owners.  Maintaining
a FAQ is something totally new to me, so please bear with me on any
mistakes I may make in the course of this project.  Feel free to
input suggestions, comments, etc to me: gpage@nyx.cs.du.edu or the
alternate system address: gpage@nyx10.cs.du.edu  .  Or, if you wish,
you may also reach me on FIDO Net as George Page on Zone 1, Net 104,
Node 518  -The Silver Hammer-(303)367-9701 ( in Denver,Colorado, USA).

What follows is Marko's first version of the FAQ, with succeeding
comments appended by myself.  The FTP info may not be totally current
since Marko is on extended absence from his site.  Comments are drawn
from Internet, FIDO Net, and Pearako (C-NET128) Net posts, as well as
a few comments of my own added to this FAQ file.
Thank to everyone quoted in here for their input.

Here's the FAQ file I promised. The C65 technical detail posting by
Fred Bowen was archived on my VAX/VMS account, which I don't use much
these days. Fortunately I remembered to check it.

This file can be retrieved via anonymous FTP from ftp.funet.fi. The
filename for the GNU zipped version is /pub/cbm/faq/c65-faq.1.0.gz, the
uncompressed version is /pub/cbm/faq/c65-faq.1.0.

 So, here it goes:

        Commodore 65 Frequently Asked Questions - Version 1.0


Around the year 1990 or 1991, Commodore Business Machines was planning
to introduce a successor for the famous Commodore 64, the Commodore
65.  The project was canned, mainly because of huge amounts of
software that pushed the C64's video chip to its limit, and did not
work at all with the new C65's video controller, CSG 4567. Also, the
machine might have been too expensive to interest the big audience.

In this file there are a few articles captured from the newsgroup
comp.sys.cbm and from some other sources. I hope that they will
saturate your need of information.

This file was put up by Marko Mdkeld <Marko.Makela@Helsinki.FI>.
I do not have a C65, so please direct your inquiries to the
comp.sys.cbm newsgroup.

Apparently Grapevine picked up some C65's during Commodore's liquidation
of its warehouse/storage areas a couple months ago.

What is a C65?  A product that almost made it out the door.  What you're
seeing are "alpha" pilot-production units.  There were only something
like 50 units made, and a dozen or more of these were distributed around
engineering, system developers, etc.  Obviously, they were never meant
to be sold to the public, but...

I guess that's enough for now.  But be warned- these boards are very out
of date- the ROMs, PLA's, etc. are pre-pre-preALPHA, there are absolutely
NO spare parts (so if it breaks, that's it!), all systems are PAL (but
they display okay on regular 1084-type monitors in analog mode).  Oh,
and there aren't any manuals.  I'm surprised that Grapevine can sell them
as "new" equipment.  Buyer beware, and all that.

All things considered, not a bad machine, though.  I still use mine :-)

Message 60        Thu Dec 23, 1993
R.DAY                        at 20:08 EST


I have my c65! Got it today about 3 hours ago. I looked at how the power plug
hooks up and it's the same as the 1581! Only it needs 2.2 amps for +5 volts
and .5 amps for the 12 volts. I just pluged in my power supply from my 1581
that will all so power 3 other drives. It came up the 1st time on my 1084
monitor. The 9 pin plug plugs right in and the U shaped din plugs right in.
Only black and wight in 40 mode but color in 80 mode. looks like a 128 using
40 or 80 in the 80 mode. The power pupply that comes with it does not have any
plug on the end for the power to the wall. Input says 240VAC 0.17A. You can
hold down the C= key to be in 64 mode. Stereo player will load and work but
does not see the 2nd 8580 sid chip. There is 2 of them in the c65. My guess is
the 2nd one is addressed at $d480. I will have to check it out. The bilt in
drive is a 81 says 73,copyright cbm cbdos v1.0,00,00 The one in my C65 does
not work too good. I have to figger out how to make it a nother device #. You
can plug in a C= modem and the cartridge port will not fit c64 or 128
cartridges. I think it would with a adapter. The pins are closer together just
a little. in the c65 mode you can to in a moniter it's like the 128. You can
even say go64 and it ask are you sure? It goes there right away. The video is
very good. It just has a border on the top and buttom about 1 inch. each and
the sides are a little showing. So that the screen is a little wider. Well any
one can get this! Just get the HD power pupply from CMD. But this cost I think
$50. It should plug right in to the C65! I got mine from a nother  place and
had to put a case on it but only cost me about $30. Has more amps then the CMD

one too. Well I will have to figger this one how it works more but looks like
it's just a nother 128 with a bilt in 1581. The inside on the board said for
some chip names: DMAGIC, VICTOR, BILL, and ELMER. It all so has this:
LASSA/GARDEI/NINESPCB/ANDRADE/JP/TL/HM/TC/CW/FISH/HD/GT/DF/BF/ETC and mine
says C64 DX REV 2B commodore electronics ltd copyright (c) 191990 all rights
reserved. Well I guess that's all I can say about it. It just took them long
to get it to me. I will have to clean some of the dust off the keyboard too.

With trembling hands I opened the large box from The Grapevine Group.
My wife grabbed the invoice and said, "What's a C65 with built-in disk
drive?".  This is what I hoped to find out!


"Ta-da!"  A box full of foam beads.  Dig, dig, what's this?  Something
solid...

And in the box was -

1 D.S.G. packet,
1 piece carbon paper - crumpled,
1 latex glove - grey,
1 packet containing a 75 Ohm co-ax cable with identical ends (the sort
that plug into a C64) and a TV-computer switch box,
1 beige power supply, with the familiar C= on top, a 4 pin round
connecter at one end and a flat 2 pin wall plug with round pins.  The
underside has "FOR C65 ONLY POWER SUPPLY".  The word C65 is on a sticker.

Oh, there was one other thing in the box :)))))))))))))))))))))

A computer.

Normal C= beige colo(u)r.  Key lettering like that on a C128.
Computer is about 18" by 8", and like a flat 128, but no separate
keypad (there's a 3.5" disk drive there instead :).  The drive points
forward, with the eject button on the leading edge of the keyboard.


Key layout is as follows.


<power                                                   <drive
 light>                                                   light>

Run              Caps No        F1 F3 F5 F7   F9  F11 F13 Help
Stop     Esc Alt Lock Scroll    F2 F4 F6 F8   F10 F12 F14

<-  1   2    3   4    5      6  7  8  9  0  + -   #   Clr Inst

Tab  q    w   e   r    t      y  u  i  o  p  @  *  ^    Restore

Ctrl S/Lock a s d  f    g      h  j  k  l  :  ;  =  return

C= Shift z    x  c  v    b      n  m  <  >  /  Shift ^

            ...........space...............        < v >

Note that # is the English pound symbol.


Also, there's a spot where a metal plaque could go, like on the 64s.


Okay, now for a tour around the computer.

Left side has a reset button, Cont port 1 and 2 (joystick ports), the
power switch and power inlet.

Right side is blank.

Back has, (from left as you look at it) a round hole labelled disk
drive (but nothing there), a video port (like 128's), a switch (or
screw) labelled "L H", an RF port, an RGB video port, a Stereo port
with R & L ports, a User port, a CBM serial port, and finally an
expansion port.

Underneath there's a flap which conceals what appears to be a miniture
centronics port, and the manufacturer's label.  It reads -

C= commodore
Model C65
Power 5vDC @ 2.2A 12vDC @ 5A
SERIAL NO. 000062 :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))
FCC ID NO.
         made in hong kong

Funkenstort n.DBP-Vtg 1046/84

So there you have it, a real? C65.  (The :)))) above is my editorial
comment!)

Unfortunately I can't tell you anything about its operation yet,
because I haven't fired it up yet (mainly due to the incorrect plug on
the power supply).  But rest assured I'll report as soon as I do! :)

Well after three months the Commodore 65 finally arrived but no thanks to UPS.
The '%&'&%$ drivers left the computer on the back steps along a wall where you
could not see it.  The poor thing sat outside for several days while it snowed
here in Colorado.  When I opened up the box water came pouring out.  Thank God
it did not seem to effect the computer.

So far I have it up and running and here are a few of the facts I have learned
so far.

        1. There are two modes of operation a C65 and C64.  You switch with
           the command GO 64 or hold down the commodore key.

        2. The Computer displays in RGB anc Composite video for both modes it
           used the RGB also (Very sharp C64 Screen).

        3. There are two sound channels at the back of the computer (2 sids I
           belive).

        4. The computer has both 40 and 80 column screens.  Both allow
           sprites.

        5. There is a 1581 style drive built in.

        6. The computer is approx. the size of the Commodore 128D's key board
           or if you took a regular 128 and cut it in half right above the
           power light.

        7. The key board layout is similar to the 128 but there are several
           differences.  The crsr keys from the top of the 128 key board are
           moved to where you would find the keys on the 64. They are laied
           out much better not straight across.  There is the following keys
           across the top RUN STOP, ESC, ALT, CAPS, NO Scroll then F1, F3,
           F5, F7 and finally F9, F11, F13, HELP.  There is no Key Pad instead
           the disk drive is there and the disks slide in toward the front for
           the computer.

        8. There is a cartridge port on the left rear (The Pins are smaller
           then a Commodore 64). I don't think that an old cartridge will run
           on it.

        9. There is a regular size user port.  There is also an expansion port
           the bottem of the computer along the lines of the Amiga.

        10. In the C65 mode there is a Machine Moniter.  It shows that you can
            Program from locations 0000 to FFFFFF.  At this time I dont know
            how much ram is built in.  It allows the use of the BANK command.

        11. I have been able to run numerous C64 programs on it.  THe verison
            I have is a PAL one so some of the graphics are messed up mainly
            on Demos.

Well I know that there is a lot more to it then the above.  Please excuse any
typos.  If anyone has any questions please ask.

Had my hands on a C65 for a little while today, and managed to get a few
of my questions answered!  The local user who had already received his
came by to try it out on my monitor, cause his Amiga one didn't totally
like it.  Anyway, his is a PAL machine. No serial number or ID or anything
on it, unlike Ralpheys, who had numbers on his.  On my 1084S monitor, in
80 column ANALOG RGB mode (as opposed to the digital that the 128 likes),
it behaved beautifully, except for some minor flicker-almost like a really
mild interlace flicker.  BOTH (yes BOTH) the 40 column 64 screen and the
40 & 80 column come up in full, sharp, clear, brilliant color in the
monitor's 80 column RGB mode!  They apparently double the pixel size or
whatever it is that does that, to create a simulated 40 column screen.  In
the 40 column Chroma/Luma/Sync mode of the monitor and 64 mode of the
computer, it just comes up in black & white.  It runs about 85% of the
tested NTSC games/demos/whatever with no problems.  Had mixed results
trying some PAL demo's and games on it.  F'instance, running a preview of
Lemmings from Force or Format that had a Euro title screen on it cleared
up the intro, but the game tore up badly.  On an NTSC machine, the intro
was the normal (for NTSC) PAL glitchy, but the game was fine!  The second
Lemmings demo that I snapped from the magazine tape recently runs fine on
both machines.  We ran Stereo-Sid player V10/11 on it with a couple of
songs, and it worked fine when we selected the proper address.
    We tried, but were unable to access any external drives through the
serial port. His did not have the "external drive" mini-DIN socket
installed on the motherboard.
   (Oh, and by the way, when we were connected to the monitor for 80col
mode, it was through the normal 9pin DIN cable that my 128 normally uses).

It has arrived!

After sacrificing a good deal of time I should have been sleeping (and
paying for it that night at work), I learned a few things about the
C65:

First, a 1581 power supply (at least the one I have) *is* sufficient
to power the machine. The power supply does get quite warm in doing so,
but I worked at least a few hours with no problems. However, for long
term reliability (of the power supply), I would still advise the use of
something with more reserve, such as a CMD HD power supply, or a PC
power supply with a 4-pin DIN grafted on.

The only flaw I have found in the construction of the machine is that
the right cursor key binds. This was true for another person on
comp.sys.cbm, and in his case, turned out to be a fixable construction
flaw. Since I will be taking mine apart, I should be able to remedy
this on mine in much the same manner as he did.

The cursor keys are in a inverted "T" arrangement, just like the
Amiga and most modern PC keyboards.

The C65 screen comes up beautifully on my 1080's screen in gloriously
crisp RGB analog, with a deep blue background, and white text,
defaulting to 80 columns. The borders are very small, giving more
screen real estate than a C64. Their is a rainbow of color bars at the
top left, the "COMMODORE C65 DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM" logo, and the
BASIC 10 logo with the revision number (which is 0.9xxxxx something;
I forgot to write all those numbers down <grin>). Oh, and it also
says "NO EXPANSION RAM PRESENT". (The C65 has a hatch on the bottom
roughly 3" x 6" [I have not measured it yet] with an expansion
connector inside, similar to the Amiga 500 and 1200).

Now for some info most of you might find of some interest, but fellow
and future C65 owners will especially want to take note of. (Most of
this message will be posted on the Commodore groups on Delphi, GEnie,
and comp.sys.cbm).


FUNCTION KEYS:

 F1 - Toggles from 40 columns to 80
 F3 - "DIR"
 F5 - Moves cursor to beginning of prior word (or space if blank line)
 F7 - Moves cursor to beginning of next word
 F9, F11, F13  - No apparent function
 HELP - "HELP"

 The shifted function keys:

 F2 - Erases all below cursor
 F4 - "DIR "*=PRG""
 F6 - "KEY 6"
 F8 - Goes in machine language monitor

 F10, F12, F14 - "KEY x" (x = fkey#)


Issuing a "PRINT FRE(0)" command gives a result of 57,085. An argument
of (1) gives 55,296. (2) gives 0, and (3) gives an illegal quantity
error.

POKE 53280,x still changes the border color, but there is a BORDER
command that does the same (and a FOREGROUND and BACKGROUND command,
as well). Only 1-16 is accepted, in both 40 and 80 column mode, so
evidently the 265 color mode is not available in text mode (or at
least, is not the default). 0-255 is accepted if one uses the POKE,
but it rolls over after each increment of 16, resulting in the same
colors.

THE REGISTER COMMAND DECIPHERED:

The REGISTER command takes the following form:

REGISTER x,y,a,b,c

x = 0 or 1 (I don't know what this does yet)
y = 0-255 (the register number)

a = 0-15 (red value)
b = 0-15 (green value)
c = 0-15 (blue value)

Unfortunately, this has no effect on the text screen, and the GRAPHIC
command apparently has a different syntax than the C-128's BASIC.

OTHER NEW COMMANDS DECIPHERED (at least partially):

DMA: Accepts DMA0,DMA1,DMA2,DMA3. I do not know what this does, other
     than the fact that a value of 1 or 3 fills the screen with "@"
     symbols.

TYPE: Apparently displays a file (sequential) to screen. (Sorry folks,
      I did not have my disks handy to try this out).

PEN: Form is PEN x,y, where x=0-2, and y=0-255.

DPAT: Form is DPATx, where x=0-63

GENLOCK: Either GENLOCK ON or GENLOCK OFF. You will note a difference
         in the screen, but I doubt this will do much without
         genlock hardware. <grin>


CHANGE: I used the form CHANGE "CHARLE" TO "CHARLIE" , and it did not
        give me an error. I suspect this is a text editing command.

FIND: Using FIND "CHARLIE" gave no error. (In retrospect, I really
      should have written a program with REM CHARLIE in it and then
      tried this.

UNIMPLEMENTED COMMANDS:

Issuing the following commands results in an "UNIMPLEMENTED COMMAND
ERROR" (BASIC 10 was not yet finished, folks):

PAINT, PASTE, CUT, LOCATE, SCALE, WIDTH, QUIT, OFF, SET, VIEWPORT

There may have been others, but these were the ones I recorded.
BTW, if you want to search for commands, look in memory, starting
around decimal 9380.

OTHER COMMANDS:

Many other commands (such as WINDOW) appear to work just as in BASIC
7.0 on the 128. GRAPHIC CLR works, but as noted, the standard 7.0

syntax for GRAPHIC otherwise gives a syntax error.

Re: My C65 has arrived..
----------------------------------------------------------------------
And the first thing i did was take to it with a screw-driver!!  That
won't surprise people that know me!  Couldn't do much else as it
arrived with bare wires at one end of the power supply.  Was expecting
some plug, not the right one, but any one, as I have an adapter waiting
for it.

Anyway, after peeking through cartidge port (hmmm, bit small!) and user
port, something didn't look right in there, so had to investigate.
Found what looks to be a crystal (28.37156) stuck into U19, which is a
14 pin socket. Next to it is another socket (U20) which is empty.
Anyway, this crystal was 3/4 out of the socket, and one leg was bent
awkwardly, wasn't too sure where that leg belonged so that entailed a
phone call to Ralphey to get him to pull his apart and tell me where
that leg belonged.  Not where it was pointing either.

 GP> yet.  Has another "disk drive" hole in
 GP> back, but doesn't appear to be a
 GP> connection inside for it, unless it somehow hookes directly to the
 GP> motherboard.

On the motherboard just inside that 'disk drive' hole, is a square area
marked 'CN12' with 8 holes for a connector of some kind.

There is one Eprom amongst the chips, and damn, its a 32 pinner, so I
guess I won't be playing with that in the Promenade!  3 of the chips
are rather large square thingos with pins on all sides. One of these is
called Victor, and another Bill!  Another smaller chip is called Elmer!

These are markings on the board beside the chip.  Another large chip is
a 48 pinner and its called DMAGIC.  Has that both on the chip, and on
the board. Oh, that Eprom is a 27C010 BTW.

Some other markings on the board are

        C64  DX  REV  2B

All rights reserved                  Fish/hd/gt/df/bf/etc

There now, this thing must be that elusive C64 DX!!!  Odd, can't find a
second drive in here tho  :-)

Getting back to that cartridge port that seemed smaller, well that was
the hole in the case that is smaller.  C64 carts won't fit thru that,
and even if they did, well no good, as the connector inside is a 50
pin as against the C64's 44 pin.

The video chip, as noted in Fred Bowens message is a 4567. That may be
a problem here, as I notice that the Video chip in U.S. C64's is a
6567, whereas here in Oz, we get them with a 6569 video chip.  Wonder
what the difference is and what sort of a problem it will cause us. No
chance there will be a '4569' around anywhere  :-(

:: Note... Alan doesn't seem to get the "rolling screen" problem that
::   I do.

Well, after finding a useless piece of electronic equipment with a plug
on it, and a bit of rewiring on the power supply - normal looking C64
brick type, says underneath...for C65 only.  Peel off the C65 sticker,
and it then says 'for C64 only' hmmm. Another sticker says '+5 VDC
2.2A......+12 VDC 0.5A' Won't bother seeing whats under that, I think I
can guess.  Plugged it all in, hooked up a 1701, turned it all
on......Nothing... Uh Oh! hmmm try the 1084S, ah thats better, a
picture, various shades of black and white.  Oh yeah, its got an RGB d
plug, maybe that'll help. Yep, that did the trick, lovely colour... a
blue screen, and an orange border.  Do a GO64 and its just like a 64
screen, and yet somehow different.  Pixels seem wider, the C= opening
screen spreads from one side to the other, without the normal side
borders, just a hint of the border, thats all, and its a white border
too, not the normal light blue.

 It doesn't seem to like another drive hooked in on the serial port.  I

the drive light flickers normally when the C65 is switched on, when I
do a LOAD"$",9 it responds with 'searching' but no activity from the
drive at all.  Returns with a 'ready' a few seconds later. List gives
me nothing.  If I try a Load"$",10 I correctly get a 'device not

Seems to respond to a lot of the C128 commands.  'KEY' gives the

Header correctly formats a 1581 disk.

Went searching with the monitor and found lots of command words, many
of them as found in the C128, some of which react the same, some don't
though.  Graphic won't do what I expect, can't find how to get it to
do anything.

I find a number of them give me 'Unimplemented command error' namely:-

Durn-someone needs to give FIDO a thump! Haven't received these messages

Here's my additional bunch o' cents worth. Finally got mine in.  No serial
number or other such labels on it, but I did have a warranty seal over the
screw hole (which I quickly voided)-had the "loose chip syndrome".
keyboard acting flakey until all were pushed in firmly.  The built-in C65
mode monitor allows you to access all 255 banks.  There are a number of
new opcodes in there, that are using the numbers of the old "undocumented
pseudo-opcodes" that we've all been warned about. These could be the
reason for some of the C64 software not working?.  I tried a number of my
cartridges using an adaptor board I had, and found that the old 64 game
carts seemed to work OK.  However, none of the utility/fastload/snapshot
type carts commonly available would access the drive.  In fact, only the
lowly Epyx would even give functional menus. I also have been unable to
access any other than the internal drive.  Mine is a PAL model I guess, and
gives varying results on PAL and NTSC demo's and such.  The recent
"theparty" demo on here at least showed part of the title screen, but the
text never showed up properly.  More details as they develop.
I also discovered some solder splash on the bottom of the board, and a
sharp point on a jumper joint that appeared to penetrate the plastic
shield and occasionally contact the metal shield.  Fixing these defects
finally corrected my flakey keyboard problem.

The C65 does have a serial port on the back side but I have not attempted to
hook anything up to it.  It does not have any dip switches to change device
numbers on the outside.  It appears that it would not be Jiffy Dos or RamLink
compatibale (sob sob), but it could more than likely be changed to work with
it.  I had to open up the computer because UPS had shipped it so hard that it
would only work when it wanted to.  I located the problem.  It was a lose 16
Mz timing chip.

The commputers board was only approx. 4 1/2 X 11" long.  It did not look like
any other Commodore 8 bit computer I have ever seen.

The drive reads 1581 disks fine but I dont think its dos is the same.  The
Computer appears to be about 85% comp. with programs for the 64.  I dont know
if the programs that dont run are because of bugs in the computer or because
this is a PAL version.

Another thing that I talked about in the last post was the computer while in
64 mode displayed its picture in RGB mode.  This makes me think that it will
run in 4Mz mode and still show the picture.  I cant remember how to put the
128 into 2Mz mode via programing other than the FAST command.  If I have the
1902 Moniter in comp. mode the picture is in black and white.  I think
commodore was going to combine the composite picture with the RGB to make more
colors on the screen (Hard to explain you would have to see it).

While in C65 mode the pokes that you would use to turn on sprites on the 128
and 64 are the same.  It appears that many of the memory locations are the
same.

Got to let you go so I can play with the C65.

from gpage@nyx:

    In response to Ralphy's question about how I managed to hook up C64
cartridges to my C65, here is a crude but functional diagram & hook-up
instructions.  The diagram is shown looking down at the top of the
board, with the 44 contact C64 cartridge connector at the top of the
screen, and the 50 contact edge connector to plug into the C65 at the
bottom. The contacts are labeled from left to right, with the C64 con-
nectors in numeric form, and the C65 connectors in alpha form.  In the
hookup instructions to follow, I use T and B to mean top and bottom of
the board.  B1 would be directly below T1, Ba would be directly below
Ta, etc.  It's up to you as to how you wish to make this thing (if you
even want to). I would guess either etching a board, or hand wiring
would be suitable.  Distance between the two connectors is up to you.
(Within limits.  Too long and I'm sure you'll have problems).
(the numbering & lettering of contacts are mine-not industry standard).

Have fun, and keep in mind that the older 64 game cartridges seem to

Date: Wed Jan 26 05:03:12 MST 1994
Lines: 138

The following info on the C65 was provided by M.Matting (a lucky guy
with the C65 manual):
==============================
GRAPHIC - select graphic mode

GRAPHIC CLR

GRAPHIC command#, [,args]

Basically this is a modified C64-type SYS command, minus the address. In
the C64DX system, this will represent the ML interface, not the BASIC
10.0 interface which is implemented in the development system.

[*** THIS COMMAND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE ***]

GRAPHIC CLR initializes (warm-starts) the BASIC graphic system. It
clears any existing graphic modes, screens etc. and allows a program
to commence graphics from scratch

DMA - Perform a DMA operation

DMA command [,length,source(l/h/b),dest(l/h/b),subcmd,mod(l/h) [,...]]

[*** THIS COMMAND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE ***]

The DMA command defines and executes a DMA operation. The parameters are
used to construct a DMA list, which is then passed to the DMA processor
for execution. Refer to the DMA chip specification for details. Chained
DMA commands are not allowed. (...)

DMA 3,2000,ASC("+"),0,DEC("800"),0     Fill screen with "+"

DMA 0,2000,DEC("800"),0,DEC("8000"),1  Copy screen to $18000

DMODE - Set graphic display mode

DMODE jam,comp,inverse,stencil,style,thickness
jam 0-1, complement 0-1, inverse 0-1, stencil 0-1, style 0-3,
thickness 1-8

FRE(0)  memory left in the program area (bank 0)

FRE(1)  memory available in variable area (bank 1)

FRE(2)  number of expansion RAM banks present

GENLOCK - Enable or disable video sync mode & colors

GENLOCK ON [,color#]

GENLOCK OFF [,color#,R,G,B]

To enable video sync mode and specify which colors are affected, use
the GENLOCK ON command, and list the palette color indices (0-255)
which will display external video

MOUSE - Enable or disable the mouse driver

MOUSE ON [,port[,sprite[,position]]]
port = joyport 1,2 or both (1-3)
sprite = sprite pointer (0-7)
position(x,y)
The user must load a pointer into the proper sprite area ($600-$7ff).

PALETTE - Define a color

PALETTE [screen#|COLOR],color#,red,green,blue

RMOUSE - Get the mouse position and button status

SCREEN - Graphic command

The SCREEN command is used to initiate a graphic command. It always precedes
another command word which identifies the graphic operation to be performed.

SCREEN CLR color# Clears the currently opened graphic screen using the
given color value

SCREEN DEF define a graphic screen

SCREEN DEF screen#,width,height,depth
 screen# (0-1), width (0=320, 1=640, 2=1280), height (0=200, 1=400)
 depth (1-8 bitplanes = 2-256 colors)
Defines a logical screen, specifies size and color. Does not allow access
to it and does not display the screen.

SCREEN SET - Set draw and view screens

SCREEN SET DrawScreen#,ViewScreen#   (0-1 both)
screen must be defined and opened first.

SCREEN OPEN - Open a screen for access.

SCREEN OPEN screen#[,error_variable]   (0-1)
This command actually sets up the screen and allocates the necessary memory
for it. If it's the view screen it will be displayed. If it's the draw
screen, it can now be drawn to. (...)

SCREEN CLOSE - Close a screen
==================================
I have not had a chance to try all of these on my C65, so there is a good
chance one or more are unimplemented on most or all versions of BASIC 10.0

Hi!

In addition to the infos that were posted last week
from the c65 manual, here are some _REAL_ infos,
tested on my c65 .
ROM version was 0.09.910111.

Ok.

For displaying graphics the following commands are
necessary:

screen def screen#,width,heigth,depth  - define screen# and resolution..
screen open screen#  - allocate memory for screen#...
screen set drawscreen#,viewscreen# (normally the same..)

          -  display screen...

... now all normal (basic 3.5/7.0) drawing cmds are allowed,
    line, etc. etc.

screen close screen#   - give memory free, and display text screen...

If, because of RESTORE-NMI, the text screen reappears without screen close,
all commands normally fail, because of lost memory.

Possible Resolutions are:

Resolution        screen def        Memory allocated
1280*400*1        2 1 1 - ok        64k
1280*200*1        2 0 1 - ok        32k
1280*200*2        2 0 2 - ok        64k
640*400*1        1 1 1 - ok        32k
640*400*2        1 1 2 - ok        64k
640*200*1        1 0 1 - ok        16k
640*200*2        1 0 2 - ok        32k
640*200*4        1 0 4 - ok        64k
320*400*1        0 1 1 - ok        16k
320*400*2        0 1 2 - ok        32k

320*400*4        0 1 4 - failed        64k
320*200*1        0 0 1 - ok        8k
320*200*2        0 0 2 - failed        16k
320*200*4        0 0 4 X failed        32k
320*200*8        0 0 8 X failed        64k


- failed means display ok, but screen clr palette# crashes system - RESET
X failed means screen set crashes with blank screen - RESET

I don't know, why the last three modes crash, they need the same amount
of memory as the others, 320*200*2 needs only 16k, but crashes...
Any ideas??????

Also I don't know where the memory is allocated, a print fre
during HiRes brings the same as without....

I think the 128k Modes (320*400*8) will only available with
RAM Expansion. Any suggestion, for this expansion????

The MOUSE command mentioned in the last weeks c65 article, is not
available in 0.09.91011, also RMOUSE.
GRAPHIC command# [,args] brings sytax error.

The screen modes use the color palette
PALETTE screen#,color#,R(0-15),G(0-15),B(0-15)

Changing the palette when displaying a screen crashes the system...

I don`t know how the 1-7 bitplane graphics point to their
palette color, just because i have only a green monitor.

Ok, thats enough for now. Any comments, hints etc.
please directly to me, i will post corrections/additions....

Oh, and Im still curious about all the ROM versions out there.
Until now i have mine (0.09.910111) and ralpheys (something like
0.0b.910429). Are other versions??
Im still looking for version 0.0b.910429 on disk, ralphey owns
no eprommer, so he cannot get the image...???
Any hints???
OK, bye
Simon.

Lets start with the Monitor;

    pc   sr ac xr yr ZR sp
; 000000 00 00 00 00 00 00

A new register, and opcodez to match!

LDZ $0000 : LDZ $0000,x  ..etc.

The whole family is there with it, all the branches, comparez, transferz ..etc.
[inz, dez]

What is missing for this one is Zero page stuff!

No; LDZ $aa : STZ $aa  ..etc. Assembling this in the Monitor nets the Absolute
version; LDZ $00aa.
--------------
  Also notice that the ProgramCounter has 3 bytez/6 digitz!

  Disassembling will WRAP to next BANK!

There are many in the Gadzookx category!

The most baffling one I have seen is MAP! Usualy preceeded with a loading of

Pokes to the 2048 to 2048+2000 area work on screen as you would expect,
yet the second half of the 2000 does not affect colour memory!!

Try;
 forx=55296 to 55296+1999: pokex,. :next
  ..and the last half of the screen charz will not turn black!

Using a BANK command with less than 127 will disable all of these pokes!
----------------
Basic load adress is 8193/$2001. [I like this number!]
----------------
Try this; sys8192 ..it won't mess up you Fkeys or screen colourz!
----------------
c64 Cartridge type code loaded in c65 mode with "8,1", then hit reset.
 ..bingo! c64 cartridge auto-start.
----------------
The built in 1581 drive DOS is not debugged fully!

Load and save work grand, a little faster than "41 mode" but seen slowwer than
the SSv5 turbo or Jiffy DOS.

Dload/dsave and the monitor l and s seem to work fine too! <sigh>

Fergit scratch, validate, collect ..etc! Various BAM corrupt/clobbered type
errors reported!
    -----
Any drive error incrementz the screen border colour in c65 mode, and *alwayz*
incrementz the border colour in c64 mode for any drive access.
"Development System" indicatorz I'd imagine. Realy annoy'n!!

c64 mode default TAPE device is gone! <yeaAH!>

c64 Basic ROM is 100% indentical, except for the fill bytez in the $bf50 area.
$ff vs $aa.

Quite a bit is differant in the main Kernal due mostly to deleted Tape stuff.
Too bad they didn't go the rest of the way, and change it to LDX $ba instead
of LDX #$08. Minor point. In c65 mode woulda been great!

    -----
At reset with disk in the drive file "autoboot.c65*" is loaded and RUN.
----------------
Bank 020000 has Drive DOS, c64 Basic at $02a000 to $02bfff, some odd code
right at $02c000, *some* c65 code at $02c800, char-set $02d000 to $02dfff,
Kernal $02e000 on up..

Neat being able to access c64 code in c65 mode ..haR!

Bank 03xxxx has c65 code..

Bank F0xxxx has I/O stuff..
----------------
Here is a funky one, turnz yer whole screen into a flashing cursor!!

First into the monitor w/F8.
Clear screen.
type: mf0d000 <and return>
cursor down to:
>f0d020 d6 d6 d1 d2 ....
         ^  ^
         change these to zero'z, and hit return.
Screen colour is now black.
Now cursor down to:
>f0d0f0 00 ...
^
^

Put cursor there!

Bingo! Yer whole screen is flashing!
Just move yer cursor off to stop it!
----------------
At some point some "underlines" *stay'd* on screen after I cleared it!
Bug or Plan, dunno ..yet!
----------------
]-[ighlander BBS is setting up a c65 file directory and message base to
support the c65 crowd ..see you there!     [416+588+0922, C=/ASCII/ANSI]
----------------
TPUG is starting a c65 Library.. [nothing yet!!]
5334 Yonge St. Box #116, Willowdale, Ont, Can. M2N 6M2
----------------
 This is great fun! Lotz more to come of course after some serious head
scratching!
 ..I wanna see some of those Extra colourz NOW!

[Please pass this on..:]

 Ok, I know all those z-Register commands, but there are some I dont
know, like BBS0-BBS7.
Also there are the W commands (DEW,  ROW, ...). Lokks like they are
WORD (16 bit) commands, working on stack and/or zeropage,.
Another question is the PC, is it true 24 Bit or not??
Could be the B commands (TRB,..) working directly on the bank
register.??

I'm still looking forward for an answer by Fred Bowen, posting the
4510 data-sheet....


Please post any changes, suggestions to this list directly to me...
I will correct and post it again. Any test programs, for bank
switching are welcome...

Bye,
Simon.

BTW: I saw A C65 (rpt C65!). I wouldnt have believed it.
the guy told my that ca 1000 where produced...
...for the german-readers:
Its on sale at the HOBBYTRONIC in DORTMUND (it was yesterday)
costs 998.-DM (ca 500$).
there where a speed-up-kit for the c64 to 8Mhz available too.

--------------------------------------------
gpage note: we in the U.S. first heard about the availability of these
computers through an ad placed in a few magazines by The Grapevine
Group back in Sep/Oct '93. They were originally listed at (US$)95.50,
but the price was quickly shifted to $129, possibly due to their
extra expense of trying to find suitable power supplies(?). The first
small batch they sold were NTSC, and the rest apparently were PAL,
with letters being mailed out to allow U.S. buyers to cancel.  They
attempted to obtain NTSC chips from CBM, but were unsuccessful.  I
had ordered mine when I first heard about them, on 15Sep93.  I finally
received it the 2nd week of Jan'94.  I am still trying to find out
just how many were produced and made available. A Grapevine spokes-
person guessed "about 300", Fred Bowen said about 50, and the German
source in the last message said about 1000.  On the echos I'd say
we've heard of a max of 20.

Since the chip complement hasn't been mentioned yet, I'd figure I'd
add the rundown of mine to this file.  Unfortunately, I don't know
what all of them are, and aren't sure enough on some others, so I'm
just listing numbers and maybe descriptions. Don't want to mislead
with wrong guesses :)

First, my C65 has no label or S/N. The screen ROM message is
Basic 10.0  V0.9.910111         English Keyboard

     "I need the pin out of the video connector on the Commodore

     "I believe that I need both HORIZONTAL & VERTICAL SYNCS AND
      THE PINS OF THE GROUND AND THOSE OF EACH COLOR RED, GREEN,
      AND BLUE."

When looking at the DB-9 RGB port, it should be arranged as follows:

                      1 2 3 4 5
                       6 7 8 9

     7 - Composite sync
     8 - Horizontal sync
     9 - Vertical sync



Several of us have checked and confirmed that the Amiga "belly hatch" RAM
expander boards will not fit onto the C65's belly hatch connector.

The release date of this FAQ file #2 is 7 Feb '94.
